# Bloggs
Blogggs is a website based on the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). 

## Overview
The frontend repo utilizes the ReactJS library/framework. Bootstrap was used for the site's styling. The backend uses ExpressJS as a web server framework and follows the RESTful API architecture. MongoDB was used as the application's database (and the Mongoose library as an ORM). JWT (Json Web Tokens) along with the PassportJS library were used to create protected routes. The frontend application was deployed using Vercel and the backend application was deployed using Glitch.Â
